# community-book
A full-stack web app using React (TypeScript) and Spring Boot (Java) for my apartment residents to post and browse used books to give away or sell cheaply. Includes RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL, Postman-tested endpoints. Built to support my local community and to practice good object-oriented programming and software engineering practices.
